# Overnight hike safety checklist (signal + SOS)

## Signal reality
- Do not assume full cellular coverage on the entire trail.

## Pre-trip
- Share itinerary with a trusted contact (start / camp / descend / finish check-ins + latest check-in time).
- Enable iPhone Emergency SOS + emergency contacts.
- Carry power bank + spare cables.
- Bring whistle + headlamp.

## During trip
- Check-in at: trailhead, mid-trail, campsite set, start descent, trail end.
- If signal weak: move to open ridge/clearing; try SMS/phone first.

## If emergency
- If signal: call 110/120; share coordinates + status + headcount.
- If no signal: stay together; prioritize warmth/shelter; move to open area; use whistle (3 short bursts repeating) + headlamp flashes.
