# For hikers (use the service)

outsideclaw aims to reduce hiking risk with:
- off-route guidance (direction + distance)
- key-node hazard reminders
- sharp weather-change alerts
- privacy-first local data by default

## How you use it
Today the primary UI is **Telegram** (sending routes + location messages).

Typical flow:
1) Export a GPX/KML route (from your hiking app) and send it to the outsideclaw bot
2) Bind the route: `/use <routeId>`
3) During the hike, send location (or live location) and ask `/g`

## Safety notes
- Cellular coverage is not guaranteed on trails.
- Always share an itinerary + latest check-in time with a trusted contact.
